Content Crew - CURRENTLY DISABLED

This crew handles content creation and calendar management.
Agents work together to create engaging podcast content and manage calendar invitations.

NOTE: This crew is currently disabled because it depends on TTSMCPTool and CalendarMCPTool
which have been removed from the project. To re-enable this crew, you would need to:
1. Implement alternative TTS and calendar tools
2. Update the agents to work with different tools or knowledge-based approaches
3. Modify the tasks to work without external API calls
